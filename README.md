# README

Welcome to my Sandwiches Rails APP!

In this APP, you'll be able to log in, log out, and sign up

First thing you might want to do is Sign up(I assume you're visiting this site for the first time)

After logging in, you'll be able to create sandwiches and even set their delivery name.

You can also modify the orders as you wish.

If the ingredients are incorrect, you can just modify and add the ingredients that you see fit!

Things to do first:

Run "bundle"

Some people also encountered the webpacker error page. Do not worry! That's an easy fix! By running the command below, it should fix.

Run "bundle exec rails webpacker:install"
